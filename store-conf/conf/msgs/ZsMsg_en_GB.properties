  Possible values \
  nio - Use NIOFSDirectory. Uses java.nio's FileChannel's positional io when reading to avoid synchronisation when reading from the same file. \
  mmap - Use MMapDirectory. Uses memory-mapped IO when reading. A good choice if there is plenty of virtual memory relative to index size. \
  simple - Use SimpleFSDirectory. Uses java.io.RandomAccessFile. It has poor concurrent performance as it synchronises when multiple threads read the same file. \
  If no value is provided, FSDirectory will choose the best implementation for the environment.
zimbra_index_rfc822address_max_token_count = The maximum token count of addresses in the RFC822 address token stream. The limit applies to all \
