Yeah, early classes like java.util.Hashtable and Vector were internally 
synchronized with respect to reads and writes.

It may be interesting to note that when Collections came along, most of the 
classes came with a note in big bold letters that access to them must be 
externally synchronized.  Given that Collections has been very 
well-received and is probably the single most-used API in the JDK, I wonder 
how much of a requirement threadsafe XMLBeans really is going to be for users.

I think you should be careful not to make the same mistakes that the
JDK<br>
made early on with the map implementations.&nbsp; The early map
implementations<br>
were thread safe and very slow, so no-one used them.&nbsp; It might be
best to<br>
have two implementations of the store (one that is thread safe &amp; one
that<br>
isn't) so that users can choose safety over performance.&nbsp; Or
performance if<br>
they know the data will only be read in a single thread as may be the
case<br>
in WS-invocations...<br><br>

&gt; Eric, was thinking about the threading/object creation etc<br>
&gt; issues over the<br>
&gt; weekend.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Another interesting issue: currently we use a finalizer on<br>
&gt; cursors, but<br>
&gt; finalizers seem to be fairly expensive, so apps that spew out<br>
&gt; lots and lots<br>
&gt; of cursors have issues.&nbsp; I wonder what problems we'd have
to<br>
&gt; deal with in<br>
&gt; order to eliminate the finalizer, and whether or not that<br>
&gt; would be possible,<br>
&gt; or if it would come into conflict with some of the other<br>
&gt; parameters of the<br>
&gt; problem just like synchronization?<br>
