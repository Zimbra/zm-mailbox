Subject: Test Phone Number Formats


When international phone numbers appear in text, they are not recognized. I
think this would be pre-GA enhancement that we need in general, but I think it's
a bug that the last 10 digits in the following text are recognized as U.S.
numbers (i.e., that the +91 gets dropped). My $.02. -S


+91-805-123-6738 (home)
+91-988-019-3964 (cell)

The following number:

+91-805-123-6738

is recognized as "805-123-6738" and attempts to call +1805-123-6738.
