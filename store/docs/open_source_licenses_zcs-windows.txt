The MIT License is about as close to Public Domain as a license can get, and is described in clear, concise terms at: http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiMIT_License

The full text of the MIT License follows:
========================================================================
Copyright (c) 2007-2010 Baptiste Lepilleur

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

(END LICENSE TEXT)

The MIT license is compatible with both the GPL and commercial software, affording one all of the rights of Public Domain with the minor nuisance of being required to keep the above copyright notice and license text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the Public Domain "license" you can re-license your copy using whatever license you like.
