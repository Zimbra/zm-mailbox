/**
 * Logical, server-managed entities must implement this interface. A module
 * represents an operational unit and may contain zero or more services
 * and rely on zero or more services that may be hosted by the container.
 * <p/>
 * In order to be hosted in the Jive server container, all modules must:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implement the Module interface</li>
 * <li>Have a public no-arg constructor</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * The Jive container will run all modules through a simple lifecycle:
 * <pre>
 * constructor -> initialize() -> start() -> stop() -> destroy() -> finalizer
 *                    |<-----------------------|          ^
 *                    |                                   |
 *                    V----------------------------------->
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * The Module interface is intended to provide the simplest mechanism
 * for creating, deploying, and managing server modules.
