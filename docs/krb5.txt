Grab the source from:

http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/

To install, read the install guide (currently online at http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/krb5-1.6/), or follow these steps (as root):

1. tar xvf krb5-1.6.2-signed.tar

2. tar tzvf krb5-1.6.2.tar.gz

3. cd krb5-1.6.2/src

4. ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

5. make

6. make install

7. edit/create /etc/krb5.conf. A sample krb5.conf file looks like:

[libdefaults]
        default_realm = MACPRO.LOCAL

[realms]
        MACPRO.LOCAL = {
                kdc = macpro.local
                admin_server = macpro.local
         }

[domain_realm]
	.local = MACPRO.LOCAL

[logging]
    kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log
    admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmin.log
    default = FILE:/var/log/krb5lib.log

Substitute MACPRO.LOCAL for your Kerberos Realm name (can be whatever you want, typically your domain name uppercased though),
and "macpro.local" with the server you are installing the Kerberos KDC on.

Make sure the specified log directory exists.

The [domain_realm] section is used to map domain names to Kerberos realms.

NOTE: the /etc/krb5.conf file should get installed on any client machines using Kerberos (i.e., all the mailbox servers)

8. Create  /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kdc.conf

this is the config file used by the server. You can just copy krb5.conf to kdc.conf, since we aren't doing anything special.

9. create the kerberos database, using the same REALM name as step (7):

/usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util create -r MACPRO.LOCAL -s

10. create: /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl

this is the ACL file used for remote admin. You can just add a single line:

*/admin@MACPRO.LOCAL *

which grants all access to any admin principals.

11. Create some Kerberos accounts, for testing/admin:

/usr/local/sbin/kadmin.local

macpro:/usr/local schemers$ /usr/local/sbin/kadmin.local
Authenticating as principal schemers/admin@MACPRO.LOCAL with password.
kadmin.local:  addprinc schemers/admin@MACPRO.LOCAL
addprinc schemers/admin@MACPRO.LOCAL
WARNING: no policy specified for schemers/admin@MACPRO.LOCAL; defaulting to no policy
Enter password for principal "schemers/admin@MACPRO.LOCAL": admin123
Re-enter password for principal "schemers/admin@MACPRO.LOCAL": admin123
Principal "schemers/admin@MACPRO.LOCAL" created.

kadmin.local:  addprinc user1@MACPRO.LOCAL
addprinc user1@MACPRO.LOCAL
WARNING: no policy specified for user1@MACPRO.LOCAL; defaulting to no policy
Enter password for principal "user1@MACPRO.LOCAL": test123
Re-enter password for principal "user1@MACPRO.LOCAL": test123
Principal "user1@MACPRO.LOCAL" created.
kadmin.local:  exit

The second user (user1@MACPRO.LOCAL) we created will be used for testing. First user is an admin user, and only needed for remote admin.

12. Start up the KDC and the kadmind:

  /usr/local/sbin/krb5kdc
  /usr/local/sbin/kadmind

You should be able to now config external Kerberos AUTH for passwords.

This document should get updated when we add SASL IMAP support, etc.

13. Create IMAP service principle

For each server, create a service principle for the Zimbra IMAP service.
This should be of the form "imap/<host>@<realm>" where <host> is the fully
qualified host name of the Zimbra server and <realm> is the Kerberos
realm name. The server host name *must* match the the value of the
"zimbra_server_hostname" local configuration property. For example:

macpro:/usr/local schemers$ /usr/local/sbin/kadmin.local
Authenticating as principal schemers/admin@MACPRO.LOCAL with password.
kadmin.local:  addprinc -randkey imap/macpro.local@MACPRO.LOCAL
WARNING: no policy specified for imap/macpro.local@MACPRO.LOCAL; defaulting to no policy
Principal "imap/macpro.local@MACPRO.LOCAL" created.

14. Create local keytab for service principle

For each server, a keytab file must be created with the service principle
key. This file should be located in $ZIMBRA_ROOT/conf/krb5.keytab where
ZIMBRA_ROOT is the Zimbra installation directory (i.e. /opt/zimbra).

macpro:/usr/local schemers$ /usr/local/sbin/kadmin.local
Authenticating as principal schemers/admin@MACPRO.LOCAL with password.
kadmin:  ktadd -keytab /opt/zimbra/conf/krb5.keytab imap/macpro.local@MACPRO.LOCAL
Entry for principal imap/macpro.local@MACPRO.LOCAL with kvno 3, encryption type Triple DES cbc mode with HMAC/sha1 added to keytab WRFILE:/opt/zimbra/conf/krb5.keytab.
Entry for principal imap/macpro.local@MACPRO.LOCAL with kvno 3, encryption type DES cbc mode with CRC-32 added to keytab WRFILE:/opt/zimbra/conf/krb5.

15. Set ZIMBRA_KERBEROS_REALM environment variable

This is used by the build script to automatically provision zimbraForeignPrinciple for the 'user1' test user account. Otherwise, the default is to use the ZIMBRA.COM realm.


===================================================================================
Provisioning Tasks on the Zimbra side:

(A) Prepare a domain fpr kerberos5 auth:
    1. Set domain auth mechanism to kerberos5
           zmprov md example.com zimbraAuthMech kerberos5

    2. Set domain zimbraAuthKerberos5Realm to the kerberos5 realm in which users in this Zimbra domain are created in the kerberos database
           zmprov md example.com zimbraAuthKerberos5Realm EXAMPLE.COM


(B) Provisioning Zimbra account.  
    When a user attemps to login to Zimbra as user/password, and when the domain's zimbraAuthMech is kerberos5, system will auth to kerberos KDC;
    with a kerberos principal and the password entered by user.
    The kerberos principal can be resolved by one of the two ways:

    1.  {localpart-of-Zimbra-email-address}@{zimbraAuthKerberos5Realm} 
        For example, for user1@example.com, the kerberos5 principal will be user1@EXAMPLE.COM

    or

    2. Kerberos5 principal can also be resolved on a per-account basis, instead of grabbing the realm from zimbraAuthKerberos5Realm.
       This allows accounts in the same Zimbra domain to be mapped to different kerberos realms.  
       To do this, Set the account's zimbraForeignPrincipal as kerberos5:{kerberos5-principal}.  
       When user login to Zimbra as user/password, and when the domain's zimbraAuthMech is kerberos5, and if zimbraForeignPrincipal starts with "kerberos5:", 
       system will auth to kerberos using the credential appear after the "kerberos5:" in zimbraForeignPrincipal.

       For example:
           zmprov ma user2@example.com +zimbraForeignPrincipal kerberos5:pshao@MYREALM.COM

       In the above example, for user2@example.com, the kerberos5 principal will be pshao@MYREALM.COM
