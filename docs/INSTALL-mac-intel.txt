== Install Instructions for Intel Mac OS X ==

The following instructions detail how to get a development
environment setup for Zimbra on an Intel Mac running OS X 10.4. In
each section below, links to the necessary software is provided.
However, if inside Zimbra many of these packages are already 
downloaded and are available at http://kenny/public/software/ 
so try there first. 

Some notes on the software:

   * Perforce - install the latest version
   * MySQL - you MUST install the x86 version, version 5 (or higher)


=== Perforce ===

Download and install client from http://perforce.com/perforce/downloads/macosx104x86.html

Setup p4 client with following information:

P4USER = {user_name}
P4PORT = depot:1666
P4CLIENT = {client_name}

P4 View:
		
	For the basic server only include:
		//depot/main/ZimbraCommon/... //{client_name}/ZimbraCommon/...
		//depot/main/ZimbraIM/... //{client_name}/ZimbraIM/...
		//depot/main/ZimbraServer/... //{client_name}/ZimbraServer/...
		//depot/main/ThirdParty/jetty/... //{client_name}/ThirdParty/jetty/...

	For the webclient also include
		//depot/main/Ajax/... //{client_name}/Ajax/...
		//depot/main/ZimbraWebClient/... //{client_name}/ZimbraWebClient/...
		//depot/main/ZimbraTagLib/... //{client_name}/ZimbraTagLib/...
		//depot/main/Zimlet/... //{client_name}/Zimlet/...

	If you are using IDEA Intellij include
		//depot/main/Zimbra.ipr //{client_name}/Zimbra.ipr

After you setup Perforce, login and sync the client. This will get
you all of the files that you will need for the rest of the install.


=== Setup build environment ===

Open a terminal shell and run the following commands:

<pre>
# set SRCDIR to P4 sync directory
export SRCDIR=~/p4/main
mkdir -p /opt/zimbra
</pre>


=== Install MySQL ===

Download and install from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#macosx-dmg

Note: Install *both* packages so that MySQL starts automatically on reboot

Run the following commands:

<pre>
sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql /opt/zimbra/mysql
</pre>

Then create /opt/zimbra/mysql/data/my.cnf with:

<pre>
[mysqld]
bind-address = localhost
port = 7306
</pre>

Start MySQL with the following command:
[Note: mysqld will start automatically on reboot]

<pre>
sudo -b /opt/zimbra/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql
</pre>

Set the password to the ant expected "zimbra".

<pre>
% /opt/zimbra/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password zimbra
</pre>


=== Install OpenLDAP ===

OpenLDAP is now installed automatically during reset-all.
The only manual change you need to make is to run "sudo
visudo" and add the following at the end of the file and
save:

<pre>
{user_name}{TAB}ALL=NOPASSWD:/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmslapd
<pre>


=== Deploy Zimbra ===

Deploy Zimbra with the following commands:

<pre>
cd $SRCDIR/ZimbraServer
ant reset-all
</pre>

You should now be able to point your browser to the following
URL and login with the username "user1" and password "test123":

<pre>
http://localhost:7070
</pre>


=== Install Mail Transfer Agent ===

In order to send mail to/from users in the Zimbra product
you will need a mail transfer agent. However, you do not need
a full MTA such as Postfix in order for this to work. Instead,
you can install a Perl script that acts as a simple MTA.

NOTE: In order to continue with this step, you need to have
installed the Mac OS X development tools. If you haven't done
this yet, insert disc 1 and install Xcode Tools/XcodeTools.mpkg

First, you need to install some Perl packages by running
the following commands: [The first time you run CPAN, you
will need to configure it -- use default settings where
possible]

<pre>
sudo -H -s
cpan
</pre>

At the CPAN prompt, type the following commands:

<pre>
install Net::SMTP::Server
install Net::LMTP
install Net::DNS
quit
</pre>

If you're use Mac OS 10.5 or later, run "sudo visudo"
and add the following line to the Defaults section:

<pre>
Defaults        env_keep += "ZIMBRA_HOSTNAME"
</pre>

to allow ZIMBRA_HOSTNAME to be exported into a sudo
environment.  Now you can run the Perl MTA with the following
commands:

<pre>
export ZIMBRA_HOSTNAME=`/opt/zimbra/bin/zmhostname`
sudo -b perl $SRCDIR/ZimbraServer/src/perl/zMTAHack.pl
</pre>

NOTE: When sending mail, you need to fully qualify the
address as {username}@$ZIMBRA_HOSTNAME. The {username} is
"user1" through "user5".


=== Starting / Stopping Servers ===

To start or stop all servers including LDAP:

<pre>
cd $SRCDIR/ZimbraServer
ant [start-servers | stop-servers]
TODO
</pre>


To start or stop LDAP:

<pre>
cd $SRCDIR/ZimbraServer
ant [start-ldap | stop-ldap]
TODO
</pre>


To start or ZCS web servers:

<pre>
cd $SRCDIR/ZimbraServer
ant [start-webserver | stop-webserver]
TODO
</pre>
