I. SPNEGO SSO

   The SPNEGO SSO feature allows AD domain users to enter their Zimbra mailbox without 
   having to re-authenticate themselves to Zimbra by entering their Zimbra credentials.
    
   Microsoft's Active Directory/Kerberos implementation is the single authentication store.
   
   It is essential that a user must logon to an AD domain, local logons will not work.
   
   Supported browsers and platforms:
   Windows:
     - Internet Explorer 6.0 or later
     - Firefox 3.0 or later
     - Chrome
     - Safari
     
   Mac:
     - Safari
   
   A high level description of the Authentication flow:
   (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms995329.aspx for more information)
   
   - User logon to a Windows/AD domain.
   - The logged-on user must have acquired Kerberos credentials from the domain.
   - The logged-on user then attempts to access Zimbra. 
   - Zimbra is configured to redirect the request to a URL under SPNEGO protection. 
   - The Zimbra server asks for authentication with Kerberos (by using SPNEGO). 
   - The client obtains a ticket for the requested service from the KDC and presents these credentials back to Zimbra server.
   - The Zimbra server extracts the user's credentials and authenticates the user.
   - The request is then redirected to the requested webapp with a Zimbra auth token.
   - The webapp adapts the Zimbra auth token and let the user in without requesting for hist Zimbra login/password.

   Important notes:
       If you enable SPNEGO SSO on a domain, you must inform/instruct all users to configure 
       their browsers properly.  Improperly configured browser will behave differently depending 
       on the browser.  The fix is to properly configure the browser.
       
       This is also required for users loggon to the local domain and not intend to
       use SPNEGO SSO.
       
       This is because of the way SPNEGO challenge sequence works.  
       1. browser sends a vanilla request to ZCS

       2. since domain is configured to do SPNEGO, server will redirect the request to a
          SPNEGO protected area if the browser UA matches one of the supported browsers.  
          This vanilla request does not carry any indication whether the user is logged 
          on as local user or domain user.

       3. Server send a 401 to challenge for a SPNEGO token.

       4. Now, if browser is not properly configured, it will *not* respond to the challenge
          and will just give up there.  The user experience is a 401 HTTP error.

       If The browser is properly configured, it will respond to the challenge.  If the user is
       logged on as a local user, the SPNEGO token in the response will not be accepted by the server.
       At this point, server will redirect the request to the regular username/password 
       login page, and user can log in by entering their Zimbra username/password.
       


II. Zimbra UI Flow

Login:
1. user login to Windows or Mac as an AD domain user or a local user

2. user browses to the regular Zimbra entry URL, e.g. http://dogfood.zimbra.com

3. a domain(e.g. zimbra.com) gets resolved by virtual host name (dogfood.zimbra.com)

4. zimbraWebClientLoginURL on domain redirects user to the spnego authentication 
   servlet.  The servlet is under spnego protection.  All requests must present a 
   valid spnego token when challenged.

5. spnego authentication happens, followed by the authorization process that 
   verifies the user indeed has an active account on the Zimbra system.

6. if spnego auth succeeds, goto 7, if failed goto step 11.

7. user is redirected into the requested webapp.

Logout:
8. user clicks on the "logout" button, and gets redirected to the zimbraWebClientLogOutURL 
   configured on the domain.

9. the logout URL points to the SSO logout page, which has a "Launch" button.  

10. user clicks on "Launch", and gets redirected to the regular Zimbra entry page (goto step 2)
 
Error: 
11. (spnego authentication or Zimbra authorization failed) user is redirected to the error URL, 
    which is defaulted to the regular username/password screen.

12. user can attempt to login by entering his Zimbra username/password.


III. Configuration
======================================
1. Create and Set Up the Keytab File
======================================

On the Windows Server AD domain controller:

(A) Create an Active Directory service account.
    This is the account you use to generate the keytab.
       
    - programs -> Administrative Tools -> Active Directory Users and Computers
    
    - right click on "Users" under the domain
    
    - new -> User 
    
    - Fill in the following:
          Full name: {a display name}

          User Logon Name: HTTP/{zimbra-mailbox-server-name} (the domain is automatically filled)
          (Note: this is the value for the {zimbra-mailbox-server-name} parameter in the setspn command (see below), and 
                 this is the value to be set for the zimbraSpnegoAuthTargetName server attribute in LDAP.)

          User Logon Name (pre-Windows 2000): {Active Directory service account name} 
          (Note: this is the name you use for the -mapUser {AD-user} parameter in the setspn and ktpass commands (see below).)

      e.g.
          Full name: zimbra-dogfood

          User Logon Name: HTTP/dogfood.zimbra.com

          User Logon Name (pre-Windows 2000): zimbra-dogfood 
      
    - click on Next

    - enter and confirm the password (e.g. test123)
      (Note: this is the password you use for the -pass {AD-user-password} parameter in the ktpass command (see below))
      
      check "password never expires"
      
    - click on "Next"
    
    - click on "Finish" to create the user.   


(B) Add the Service Principal Names (SPN) directory property for an Active Directory service account. 

    setspn -A {zimbra-mailbox-server-name} {AD-user}
    
    e.g.
    - list registered SPNs (there is none)
      C:\>setspn -L zimbra-dogfood
      Registered ServicePrincipalNames for CN=zimbra-dogfood,CN=Users,DC=vmware,DC=com:

    - add SPN for the service account
      C:\>setspn -A HTTP/dogfood.zimbra.com zimbra-dogfood
      Registering ServicePrincipalNames for CN=zimbra-dogfood,CN=Users,DC=vmware,DC=com HTTP/dogfood.zimbra.com
      Updated object

    - list registered SPNs (should see the one we just added)
      C:\>setspn -L zimbra-dogfood
      Registered ServicePrincipalNames for CN=zimbra-dogfood,CN=Users,DC=vmware,DC=com:
      HTTP/dogfood.zimbra.com


(C) Create the keytab file
   
    ktpass -out {keytab-file-to-produce} -princ {Service-Principal-Name}@{the-kerberos-realm} -mapUser {AD-user} -mapOp set -pass {AD-user-password} -crypto RC4-HMAC-NT -pType KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL
    
    e.g.
    The following will create jetty.keytab file under c:\Temp\spnego:
    
    C:\>ktpass -out c:\Temp\spnego\jetty.keytab -princ HTTP/dogfood.zimbra.com@VMWARE.COM -mapUser zimbra-dogfood -mapOp set -pass test123 -crypto RC4-HMAC-NT -pType KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL
    Targeting domain controller: test-dc.vmware.com
    Using legacy password setting method
    Successfully mapped HTTP/dogfood.zimbra.com to zimbra-dogfood.
    Key created.
    Output keytab to c:\Temp\spnego\jetty.keytab:
    Keytab version: 0x502
    keysize 71 HTTP/dogfood.zimbra.com@VMWARE.COM ptype 1 (KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL) vno3 etype 0x17 (RC4-HMAC) keylength 16 (0xc383f6a25f1e195d5aef495c980c2bfe)
    
    
(D) Place the Keytab File on Zimbraserver   
    copy jetty.keytab created in step (C) to the zimbra server (e.g. dogfood.zimbra.com) as /opt/zimbra/data/mailboxd/spnego/jetty.keytab
    
    Note: Do not rename the keytab file, the name(jetty.keytab) is referenced from various configuration files.


Repeat steps (A) to (D) for each zimbra server(e.g. catfood.zimbra.com, corp.zimbra.com).


=====================
2. Configure Zimbra
=====================
- For production system, do 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.

- For dev system: do "ant spnego-dev-deploy" under ZimbraServer.


2.1. Configure Global Config
----------------------------
We support only one REALM per Zimbra installation.

Modify the following global config attributes with "zmprov mcf" command.

zimbraSpnegoAuthEnabled     : TRUE
                              e.g. zmprov mcf zimbraSpnegoAuthEnabled TRUE

zimbraSpnegoAuthErrorURL    : URL to redirect users to on spnego auth failure.
                              If not set, the default is the requested webapp's 
                              regular login page.
                     
zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm       : the kerberos realm in the domain controller
                              e.g. zmprov mcf zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm VMWARE.COM


2.2. Configure Servers
----------------------
On each zimbra server, modify the following global config attributes with "zmprov ms" command.

zimbraSpnegoAuthTargetName  : the name for the service user in III. 1. (A), 
                              e.g. zmprov ms dogfood.zimbra.com zimbraSpnegoAuthTargetName HTTP/dogfood.zimbra.com
                                   zmprov ms catfood.zimbra.com zimbraSpnegoAuthTargetName HTTP/catfood.zimbra.com

zimbraSpnegoAuthPrincipal   : {zimbraSpnegoAuthTargetName}@{zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm}
                              e.g. zmprov ms dogfood.zimbra.com zimbraSpnegoAuthPrincipal HTTP/dogfood.zimbra.com@VMWARE.COM
                                   zmprov ms catfood.zimbra.com zimbraSpnegoAuthPrincipal HTTP/catfood.zimbra.com@VMWARE.COM
  

2.3. Configure Domain
---------------------
(A) Setup kerberos Realm for the domain
    zmprov md {domain} zimbraAuthKerberos5Realm {kerberos-realm}

    {kerberos-realm} should be the same realm set in global config attribute zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm
    
    e.g. 
    zmprov md zimbra.com zimbraAuthKerberos5Realm VMWARE.COM
    
    
(B) Setup virtual host for the domain
    zmprov md {domain} +zimbraVirtualHostname {virtual-hostname-1} +zimbraVirtualHostname {virtual-hostname-2} ...
    
    virtual-hostname-* are the hostnames you can browse to for the Zimbra WEB UI.
    e.g.
    zmprov md zimbra.com +zimbraVirtualHostname dogfood.zimbra.com +zimbraVirtualHostname catfood.zimbra.com
    
    
(C) Setup web client login URL and UAs/IP addresses allowed for the login URL on the domain
    - Set login URL.  Login URL is the URL to redirect to for logging in and when
      Zimbra auth token is expired.  Set it to the spnego authentication servlet.
      zmprov md {domain} zimbraWebClientLoginURL '/service/spnego'
    
    - Honor only supported platforms and browsers.  
      zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA is a multi-valued attribute, values are regex.
      If not set, all UAs are honored. If multiple values are set, an UA is honored  
      as long as it matches any one of the values.  If UA is not honored, the request 
      will not be redirected to zimbraWebClientLoginURL.
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA {UA-regex-1} +zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA {UA-regex-2} ...
      
      e.g. honor zimbraWebClientLoginURL only for Firefox/IE/Chrome/Safari on Windows, and Safari on Mac)
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA '.*Windows.*Firefox/3.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA '.*MSIE.*Windows.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA '.*Windows.*Chrome.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA '.*Windows.*Safari.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA '.*Macintosh.*Safari.*'

    - Honor only seletced client IP addresses
      zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedIP is a multi-valued attribute, values are regex.
      If not set, any client IP address is honored. If multiple values are set, an IP address is honored  
      as long as it matches any one of the values.  If client IP is not honored, the request 
      will not be redirected to zimbraWebClientLoginURL.
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedIP '10\.112\.205\.[1-9][0-9]'
      
      
(D) Setup web client logout URL and UAs allowed for the logout URL on the domain
    - Set logout URL.  Logout URL is the URL to redirect to when user clicks on "Logout".
      zmprov md {domain} zimbraWebClientLogoutURL '../?sso=1'
    
    - Honor only supported platforms and browsers.  
      zimbraWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA is a multi-valued attribute, values are regex.
      If not set, all UAs are honored. If multiple values are set, an UA is honored  
      as long as it matches any one of the values.  If UA is not honored, user will not be 
      redirected to zimbraWebClientLogoutURL when logged out.
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA {UA-regex-1} +zimbraWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA {UA-regex-2} ...
      
      e.g. honor zimbraWebClientLogoutURL only for Firefox/IE/Chrome/Safari on Windows, and Safari on Mac)
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA '.*Windows.*Firefox/3.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA '.*MSIE.*Windows.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA '.*Windows.*Chrome.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA '.*Windows.*Safari.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA '.*Macintosh.*Safari.*'

    - Honor only seletced client IP addresses
      zimbraWebClientLogoutURLAllowedIP is a multi-valued attribute, values are regex.
      If not set, any client IP address is honored. If multiple values are set, an IP address is honored  
      as long as it matches any one of the values.  If client IP is not honored, user will not be 
      redirected to zimbraWebClientLogoutURL when logged out.
      zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLogoutURLAllowedIP '10\.112\.205\.[1-9][0-9]'

===========================
3. Configure Your Browser
===========================
Windows
    Firefox:
        1. Browse to about:config and agree to the warnings
        2. Search through to find the "network" settings (in the Filter, type "network.n")
        3. Enter a comma-delimited list of trusted domains or URLs 
           for network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris and network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris.
           e.g.
             * set network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris to http://,https://
             * set network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris to http://,https://
             or
             * set network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris to http://dogfood.zimbra.com,https://dogfood.zimbra.com,http://catfood.zimbra.com,https://catfood.zimbra.com
             * set network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris to http://dogfood.zimbra.com,https://dogfood.zimbra.com,http://catfood.zimbra.com,https://catfood.zimbra.com
    
    IE/Chrome/Safari:
        1. Tools -> Options -> Security -> Local Intranet -> Sites
             * make sure everything is checked here
        2. Tools -> Options -> Security -> Local Intranet -> Sites -> Advanced
             * add url to server (http:// and/or https://) making sure to use the hostname
        3. Tools -> Options -> Security -> Local Intranet -> Sites -> Advanced -> Close
        4. Tools -> Options -> Security -> Local Intranet -> Sites -> Ok
        5. Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Security (in the checkbox list)
             * locate and check 'Enable Integrated Windows Authentication'
        6. Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Security -> Ok
        7. close IE

Mac
    Safari:
        Do not need any configuration.


================
4. Test it out
================
- On a Windows or Mac box, login to as a domain user.
  
  Your ticket as a domain user will be saved on the computer.
  Ths token will be picked up by the spnego aware browser and send in 
  the Authorization header to zimbra server.
  
- Browse to the regualr ZWC entry page:
  e.g. http://dogfood.zimbra.com
  
- You should be redirected to your inbox, without being prompted for Zimbra username/password.

  
What happens behind the scene in ZCS server:
  - A domain gets resolved by the virtual host name setting.
    (zimbraVirtualHostname on domain)
  
  - The request gets redirected to the login URL on the domain.
    (zimbraWebClientLoginURL on domain)
  
  - spnego authentication and Zimbra authorization happens
  
  - if authentication or authorization fails, user will be redirected to an error URL.
    (zimbraSpnegoAuthErrorURL on global config)
    
  - if authentication and authorization succeeds, user will be redirected into the 
    requested webapp.
    

=====================
4. Trouble Shooting
=====================
(1) Make sure the following are true:
    - Intranet Zone
    - Accessing the server using a Hostname rather then IP
    - Integrated Windows Authentication in IE is enabled, the host is trusted in Firefox
    - The Server is not local to the browser
    - The client's Kerberos system is authenticated to a domain controller


(2) If the browser display the "401 Unauthorized", it's most likely that the browser either 
    did not send another request with Authorization in response to the 401, or had sent an 
    Authorization which is not using the GSS-API/SPNEGO scheme.  
    
    Check your browser settings, and make sure it is one of the supported browsers/platforms.  


(3) If you are redirected to the error URL specified in zimbraSpnegoAuthErrorURL (or the login 
    page if zimbraSpnegoAuthErrorURL is not set), that means authentication or authorization 
    failed.
     
    Take a network trace, make sure the browser send Authorization header(Appendix A: HTTP Flow, 5) 
    in response to the 401.  Make sure (use a network packet decodeder like Wireshark) the 
    Negotiate is using GSS-API/SPNEGO, not NTLM.
     
    After verifying that the browser is sending the correct Negotiate, if it still does not work, 
    turn on the following debug and check Zimrba logs:
     
    - ADD "-DDEBUG=true -Dsun.security.spnego.debug=all" (note, not replace) to 
      localconfig key spnego_java_options
   
    - add in log4j.properties:
      log4j.logger.org.mortbay.log=DEBUG 
      log4j.logger.zimbra.account=DEBUG
    
    then restart mailbox server.
     
    Browse to the debug snoop page:  http://{server}:{port}/service/spnego/snoop.jsp     
    see if you can access the snoop.jsp
    
    Check zmmailboxd.out and mailox.log for debug output.
     
    * One of the error at this stage could be because of clock skew on the jetty server.  
      If this is the case, it should be shown in zmmailboxd.out.  Fix the clock skew and try again.


===========================================
5. Configure kerberos auth with SPNEGO auth
===========================================
Kerberos auth and SPNEGO can co-exists on a domain.   Use case is using kerberos as the 
mechanism for verifying user principal/password against a KDC, instead of the native 
Zimbra LDAP, when user cannot get in by SPNEGO.

When SPNEGO auth fails, user is redirected to the Zimbra login screen if browser is 
configured properly.   Users can enter their Zimbra username/password on the login screen to 
login manually.  Domain attribute zimbraAuthMech controls the mechanism for verifying  
password.   If zimbraAuthMech is set to "kerberos5", user entered username is used to first 
identify a valid Zimbra user (must be provisionined in Zimbra LDAP), then from Zimbra user 
is mapped to a kerberos principal, the kerberos principal + password is then validated 
against a KDC.   This KDC could be different from, or the same as the KDC that Active Directory 
domain controller(for SPNEGO auth) is running as.    

Note, Every Microsoft Active Directory domain controller acts as Kerberos KDC.  
For SPNEGO auth, KDC is not contacted from mailbox server.  The kerberos token sent from the 
Authorization http header along with jetty's keytab file can identify/authenticate the 
user.

For kerberos auth (zimbraAuthMech="kerberos5"), mailbox server needs to contact KDC to 
validate principal+password.   For java kerberos client (i.e. Zimbra mailbox server), 
the default realm and KDC for the realm is specify in a kerberos config file.  Location of 
this config file can be specified in JVM argument java.security.krb5.conf. If not specified,
default is /etc/krb5.conf.   When SPNEGO is enabled in Zimbra, java.security.krb5.conf 
for mailbox server is set to "/opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/krb5.ini".   Therefore, that is the 
effective file for configuring kerberos auth.

/opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/krb5.ini is rewritten from /opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/krb5.ini.in 
each time when mailbox server restarts.  To configure, you need to modify the 
/opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/krb5.ini.in file, not /opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/krb5.ini.

Under [realms] section, kdc and admin_server are not set for SPNEGO auth, but they are 
required for kerberos auth.   

To configure:

(1) Edit /opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/krb5.ini.in

change:

[realms]
%%zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm%% = {
                default_domain = %%zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm%%
}

to:

%%zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm%% = {
                kdc = YOUR-KDC
                admin_server = YOUR-ADMIN-SERVER
                default_domain = %%zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm%%
}


replace YOUR-KDC and YOUR-ADMIN-SERVER to the hostname on which the 
kdc/admin_server for kerberos auth is running.

(2) save the file and restart mailbox server.


The restriction is, the realm for SPNEGO and kerberos auth must be the same.  
For SPNEGO auth, the kerberos principal in the Authorization header is mapped to a 
unique Zimbra account.  For kerberos auth, the Zimbra account is mapped to a unique kerberos 
principal.  The mapping (by domain attribute zimbraAuthKerberos5Realm) is the same for both.
