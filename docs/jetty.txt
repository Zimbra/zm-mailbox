0. If this is the first time you setup your dev env, follow steps in
   INSTALL*.txt to setup /opt/zimbra with mysql, ldap, etc.

1. You can run "ant reset-all" target of ZimbraServer project to build
   and start up the dev webapps including serivce/zimbra/zimbraAdmin.

2. On Windows if you want to install jetty as a Windows service and
   start/stop it that way, skip to 3.  For those who don't want to mess
   with Windows services, use ant targets "start-jetty" and "stop-jetty"
   of ZimbraServer project to start/stop.

3. On Windows if you really want to install jetty as a Windows service
   you can use the Java Service Wrapper.  The files are checked in
   under ZimbraServer\tools\jetty; if you'd prefer to download them
   yourself you can Yahoo! search for wrapper-windows-x86-32-3.2.3.zip
   and unzip it.  Copy wrapper.exe to C:\opt\zimbra\bin, wrapper.jar and
   wrapper.dll to C:\opt\zimbra\lib, and wrapper.conf to
   C:\opt\zimbra\jetty\etc.  Now run:

     wrapper.exe -i C:\opt\zimbra\jetty\etc\wrapper.conf 

   to install jetty as a Windows Service.  Make sure the 'C' in 'C:' is
   in upper case because wrapper.exe surprisingly is sensitive to it.

   You may need to fix the permissions on the jetty directory and its
   subdirectories in order to run jetty as a service.  Open Windows 
   Explorer.  Right click jetty directory, click Sharing and Security...
   Click Security tab.  Check if you have SYSTEM user in the list.
   If there is no SYSTEM user, click Add button, type SYSTEM, 
   click Check Names button, select the System user (usually the 
   first one), click OK.  Now select the newly added SYSTEM user, click
   all the permissions to Allow.  Then click Advanced button, and check
   "Replace permission entries on all child objects with entries shown
   here that apply to child objects".  Click OK to dismiss advanced
   dialog.  Click OK to dismiss the sharing dialog.

   To start/stop jetty service on command line, use "net start jetty"
   and "net stop jetty".

   To make sure that build.xml also uses windows service to start/stop
   jetty, set environment variable ZIMBRA_JETTY_USE_SERVICE=1.

4. On Mac OS X or Linux you should be able to bounce jetty with
   command line 'jetty start' and 'jetty stop'.

============

There are more than one way to debug jetty using Eclipse.  Here we'll
cover two approaches.

I. Conventional Debugging

1. Don't follow the instructions in "Debugging Jetty with Eclipse" on
   jetty docs site (at least it didn't work for me).

2. In Eclipse select Run/Debug... and right click on Java Application
   to "New" a configuration.  Call it anything you want, such as
   "jetty".  You can choose any project as the debug project.  That is
   unimportant.  What's important is the Main class.  Set it to
   org.eclipse.jetty.start.Main.

3. Switch to the Arguments tab and set

   Program arguments to 
   --ini OPTIONS=Server,jsp,jmx,resources,websocket,ext,jta,plus,rewrite etc/jetty.xml
   
   and VM arguments to
   "-DSTART=/opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/start.config -DSTOP.PORT=7867
   -DSTOP.KEY=stop -Dzimbra.config=/opt/zimbra/conf/localconfig.xml
   -Djava.library.path=/opt/zimbra/lib".  Then choose "Other" under
   working directory and set it to /opt/zimbra/jetty.

4. Swtich to the Classpath tab and add /opt/zimbra/jetty/start.jar to
   User Entries. Also add all the jar files of /opt/zimbra/jetty/lib/
   and /opt/zimbra/jetty/lib/jsp/

5. Switch to the Source tab and add all the java projects in your
   workspace that you care about to debug.

7. Apply the debug configuration and click Debug.  If everything goes
   well, you should be able to stop in your source code with break
   points.

8. To stop jetty you can do this on command line "java
   -DSTOP.PORT=7867 -DSTOP.KEY=stop -jar start.jar --stop".  Or you
   could run the "stop-jetty-java" target under ZimbraServer.  You
   probably don't want to press the Stop button in Eclipse debugger as
   that wouldn't do a proper shutdown.


II. Ant Jetty Plugin (personal favorite)

There's another radically different way to run and debug jetty with
jetty-ant plugin.  Basically you run jetty as an ant task.  We use
Eclipse remote debugging with jetty-ant plugin.

To use jetty-ant, first you need to setup a shell for service webapp.
Go to ZimbraServer directory and run
ant -buildfile jetty-ant.xml jetty.webinf

You'll only need to do this once unless either you clean the build directory
or changes things such as web.xml.

To launch jetty, run the following:
ant -buildfile jetty-ant.xml jetty.run

Note that due to a jetty-ant-plugin bug you need to set this env var:
ANT_OPTS="-Djava.library.path=~/zimbra/zdesktop/lib"

To debug, run the jetty.run target with ANT_OPTS like this:

ANT_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Djava.library.path=/opt/zimbra/lib -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=4000,server=y,suspend=y" ant -buildfile jetty-ant.xml jetty.run

This will start jetty-ant plugin but blocks on listening on port 4000.

Now go to Eclipse and select Run/Debug... and right click on Remote
Java Application to "New" a configuration.  Call it anything you want
such as "jetty-ant".  Select any project as the debug project.  Set
Host/Port to localhost and 4000.  Then go to Source tab and add all
the projects you are interested in debugging.

Apply the configuration settings and press "Debug".  This will attach
the debugger to the jetty-ant process.  You can see activity in the
previously blocked jetty-ant console, and debugger will stop at your
break points.

To shutdown jetty, simply send Ctrl+C to the console window where you
are running jetty-ant.
