NOTE: If you are stuck and somehow want to try your luck with tomcat, there's a build time switch.  Stop jetty if running.  Set env var ZIMBRA_USE_TOMCAT=1 and reset-the-world.

0. Here we assume you have previously been using tomcat and have setup /opt/zimbra with ldap etc.  If not, follow steps in INSTALL*.txt.

1. Copy entire folder from ThirdParty/jetty-{latest-version} to /opt/zimbra and symlink 'ln -s /opt/zimbra/jetty-{verison} /opt/zimbra/jetty.  On Windows because there's no symlink, rename the jetty directory to C:\opt\zimbra\jetty.

2. On Mac or Unix copy ZimbraServer/src/bin/jetty script to /opt/zimbra/bin.  Set env var JAVA_HOME to the right place.  On Mac OS X it should be /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home.  On Windows it depends on where you installed JDK.  JAVA_HOME is needed by the jetty start/stop script.

3. On Windows you may want to install jetty as a Windows service for convenience.  This can be achieved using Java Service Wrapper.  Google search and download wrapper-windows-x86-32-3.2.3.zip and unzip it.  Copy the wrapper.exe file under the unzipped bin directory to C:\opt\zimbra\bin.  Copy wrapper.jar and wrapper.dll under the unzipped lib directory to C:\opt\zimbra\lib.  Finally, copy your p4 ZimbraServer\conf\wrapper.conf to C:\opt\zimbra\jetty\etc.  Now run 'wrapper.exe -i C:\opt\zimbra\jetty\etc\wrapper.conf to install jetty as a Windows Service.

4. Run 'ant reset-the-world' under ZimbraServer. Then run 'ant deploy' and 'ant admin-deploy' under ZimbraWebClient as usual.  For offline, run 'ant offline-reset-the-world'.

5. On Mac OS X or Linux you should be able to bounce jetty with command line 'jetty start' and 'jetty stop'.  On Windows you can start/stop jetty by running command line 'net start jetty' and 'net stop jetty'.

============

There are more than one way to debug jetty using Eclipse.  Here we'll cover two approaches.

I. Conventional Debugging

1. Don't follow the instructions in "Debugging Jetty with Eclipse" on jetty docs site (at least it didn't work for me).

2. In Eclipse select Run/Debug... and right click on Java Application to "New" a configuration.  Call it anything you want, such as "jetty".  You can choose any project as the debug project.  That is unimportant.  What's important is the Main class.  Set it to org.mortbay.start.Main.

3. Switch to the Arguments tab and set VM arguments to "-DSTART=/opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/start.config -DSTOP.PORT=7867 -DSTOP.KEY=stop -Dzimbra.config=/opt/zimbra/conf/localconfig.xml -Djava.library.path=/opt/zimbra/lib".  Then choose "Other" under working directory and set it to /opt/zimbra/jetty.

4. Swtich to the Classpath tab and add /opt/zimbra/jetty/start.jar to User Entries.

5. Switch to the Source tab and add all the java projects in your workspace that you care about to debug.

7. Apply the debug configuration and click Debug.  If everything goes well, you should be able to stop in your source code with break points.

8. To stop jetty you can do this on command line "java -DSTOP.PORT=7867 -DSTOP.KEY=stop -jar start.jar --stop".  Or you could run the "stop-jetty-java" target under ZimbraServer.  You probably don't want to press the Stop button in Eclipse debugger as that wouldn't do a proper shutdown.


II. Ant Jetty Plugin (personal favorite)

There's another radically different way to run and debug jetty with jetty-ant plugin.  Basically you run jetty as an ant task.  We use Eclipse remote debugging with jetty-ant plugin.

To run jetty, go to ZimbraServer directory and run 'ant jetty.run'.  This task assumes that you have already deployed the webapp wars to /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps.  If you want to run jetty without even deploying, you can do so by modifying the location of the war files.

To debug, run the jetty.run target with ANT_OPTS like this:

ANT_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=4000,server=y,suspend=y" ant jetty.run

On Windows you can make a bat file to set ANT_OPTS and then run 'ant jetty.run'.

This will start jetty-ant plugin but blocks on listening on port 4000.

Now go to Eclipse and select Run/Debug... and right click on Remote Java Application to "New" a configuration.  Call it anything you want such as "jetty-ant".  Select any project as the debug project.  Set Host/Port to localhost and 4000.  Then go to Source tab and add all the projects you are interested in debugging.

Apply the configuration settings and press "Debug".  This will attach the debugger to the jetty-ant process.  You can see activity in the previously blocked jetty-ant console, and debugger will stop at your break points.

To shutdown jetty, simply send Ctrl+C to the console window where you are running jetty-ant.
