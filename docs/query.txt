Fields
--------
content-related

  content:  # this should be the default field

    
header-related

  from:
  to:
  cc:{name|domain}
  subject:

  
saved-search-related:

  my:{name-of-saved-search}
  
  i.e., could have a saved search of "domain:example.zimbra.com"
  called "zimbra" and say:
  
  my:zimbra
  
object-related fields:

  has:attachment              constrains search to messages with attachments
  has:{phone|url|ssn|po...}           messages with "objects" 

    
mime-related

  filename:{file-name}        constrains search to messages with attachments of given name
  type:{mime-type}            constrains search to blobs of the given type
  attachment:{mime-type}      constrains search to messages with attachments of the given type

  mime-type = raw-mime-type | mime-type-alias
  raw-mime-type = type/sub-type (i.e., text/plain)
  # aliases are "user-friendly" mime types
  mime-type-alias = "word" | "excel" | "pdf", "image", "audio", etc...

  EXAMPLES:  
         type:word "hello"             searches within only words docs for "hello"
         attachment:word "hello"       searches within messages that have word docs for "hello"
         attachment:image/*            matches all messages that have image attachments

         
flags

  is:anywhere --> in any folder (overrides spam-trash setting for that query part)
  is:unread
  is:read
  is:flagged
  is:unflagged
  is:sent
  is:received
  is:invite

  The flag name can also be used in a search:
    tag:\{FlagName} where {FlagName} is one of the following values:
      Attached, Answered, Copied, Deleted, Draft, Flagged, Forwarded, Notified, Subscribed, Unread
  
date-related fields

  after:{date}
  before:{date}
  date = {absolute-date} | {relative-date}

  absolute-date = mm/dd/yyyy | yyyy/dd/mm
  
  relative-date = [+/-]nnnn{minute,hour,day,week,month,year} 

  NOTE: need to figure out how to represent "this week", "last week", "this month", etc. probably
        some special casing of relative dates and use with after/before. i.e., maybe "after:-2d AND before:0d" means
        yesterday? i.e., for relative day/week/month/year, you zero out month/week/day/hour/minute?

  last 4 hours:   after:-4hour 
  today:          after:0day
  yesterday:      (after:-2day AND before:0day)
  this week:      after:0week
  last week:      (after:-2week AND before:0week)
  this month:     after:0month
  last month:     (after:-2month AND before:0month)
  this year:      after:0year
  last year:      (after:-2year AND before:0year)
  last year and older:  before:0year

size-releted fields

  larger:{size}
  smaller:{size}
  size:{size}
  
  size is [<>]nnnn{b,kb,mb,gb}    # default is kb?

  
tag-related fields

   tag:{user-defined-tag}

      
domain-related fields

  domain:{domain-list}
  EXAMPLES: domain:stanford.edu OR: domain:*.org

    
db-related fields

  message:{db-message-id}        # constrain searches to a particular message

  
conversation-related-fields:  
  conv:{db-conv-id}      # constrain searches to a paritcular conversation
*  conv-min-count:{num}   # constrain searches to conversations of a particular length
*  conv-max-count:{num}   # constrain searches to conversations of a particular length
  conv-start:{date}
  conv-end:{date}

metadata-related fields

  author:
  title:
  keywords:
  company:
  metadata:
  
  The metadata fields refer to the metadata of a non-textual attachment.
  The fields author, title, keywords, company refer to the metadata fields 
  of the same name in the document.
  The field metadata aggregates all the metadata fields including the above four.
  E.g.,
	author:acme     finds all attachments whose author is acme
	metadata:acme   finds all attachments where acme appears in any metadata
	                fields, including author.

misc fields

*  minm:nnnn                     # constrain to conversations with at least nnnn messages
*  maxm:nnnn                     # constrain to conversations with at most nnnn messages

  
other-mime-specific fields

  how do we want to handle doc properties from word, pdf, mp3, etc?

  i.e.:
         genre:rock OR artist:rush
         title:"customer visit"
         keywords:security
         author:ross

*   maybe {mime-type-alias}.field? i.e.:
  
          audio.genre:rock OR audio.artist:rush   (or mp3.*?)
          word.title:hello
          
   where the mime-type-alias can be left off if field is non-ambigious?
   
   do we want to try and promote certain fields that we can share between mulitple types? (title, author, keywords)
