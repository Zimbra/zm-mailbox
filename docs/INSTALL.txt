NOTE: Most or all binaries needed for installation are available
on the \\kenny share. For example, Windows installers are located
at: \\kenny\Public\software\windows. It might be best to copy the
installers to your local machine before installing.

0. Install Perforce (P4)

  Configure server port to "eric:1666".

1. Checkout the following from Perforce:

  LiquidArchive - the archive system, including the back-end servlets

  LiquidConsole - the dhtml interface

  LiquidAjax - DTML/Ajax toolkit
  
  Optional:  ThirdParty - not needed to run, but has javadocs and source for the
  various 3rd party jars/servers. It's very very large since all the built servers and
  3rd Party code (multiple versions) are in there.

2. Install latest JDK. Need full JDK, not just a JRE, since ant uses
   the compiler.  1.5.x
   
   Reccomend installing in c:\opt\liquid\java
   
   Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the installed
   JDK location.

3. Install Eclipse (which you probably have if you are reading this)

  You should install the Perforce plugin for Eclipse. To
  install, select Help | Software Updates | Find and Install... 
  Then select the "Search for new features to install" and hit Next. 
  From this screen, add a new remote site using the URL:
  
    http://www.perforce.com/downloads/http/p4-wsad/install/
  
  This will add a P4 entry to the list on the left. Select that and 
  continue through the wizard. 
  
  NOTE: You will need to configure the plugin with your Perforce
  information before using the Perforce Perspective.
  
  Once you get the Perforce Perspective open right click on LiquidArchive
  and select "Import as project". Do the same for LiquidAjax and LiquidConsole.

4. Install Tomcat 5.5.x

  On Windows, install Tomcat to c:\opt\liquid\tomcat
  
  copy LiquidArchive/conf/tomcat-5.5/server.xml to {tomcat-install}/conf/
  copy LiquidArchive/conf/tomcat-5.5/tomcat-users.xml {tomcat-install/conf/
  
  The server.xml file is configured to use port 7070 by
  default. Production would of course use 80, and we'll also need to
  configure SSL
  
  The LiquidArchive/build.xml relies on a liquid/liquid user in the
  tomcat-users.xml file to deploy
  
  IMPORTANT: Copy the files mail.jar, activation.jar and liquidos.jar
  from <workspace>\liquidarchive\jars to your <tomcat>\common\lib.
  
  Copy \opt\liquid\tomcat\conf\keystore to the conf directory of your
  Tomcat installation directory if it is not in \opt\liquid\tomcat.
  
  On Linux startup with:
      $ JAVA_HOME={java-home} {tomcat-install}/bin/startup.sh

5. Install MySQL 4.1.x

  On Windows, install MySQL to c:\opt\liquid\mysql

  We expect for now an admin account of "root" with password "liquid".
  This is different then the OS root account (if on Linux). The
  LiquidArchive/build.xml file relies on the root account to create
  the liquid database and user/pass.

  On Linux, you can run the script ./configure in the main directory
  of the binary mysql distribtion.  This script creates
  a minimal mysql system, and starts up mqsql server.  Use can use
  "{mysql-path}/mysqld_safe --no-defaults" to start the server and use
  "kill `cat {mysql-path}/data/{hostname}.pid`" to shut it down.  Also
  on linux after you have started the server, you have to allow
  connections to mysql which you can do by running the mqsql command
  line:

    $ mysql -u root -p
    Password: liquid     
    
    mysql> grant all on *.* to "root"@"localhost.localdomain" identified by 'liquid' with grant option;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
    mysql> flush privileges;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

  On Windows, follow instructions to install MySQL as a service
  with the required database admin user password.

6. Install OpenLDAP (Get pkg from \\kenny)

  On Windows, install to c:\opt\liquid\openldap. Then go to the
  openldap directory and run "slapd install" to install it as a
  Windows service.

7. On Linux, probably want to chown /opt to yourself and/or give group
   write access to /opt, so you don't have to worry about running as
   root.
  
   All the index, blobs, data, etc, get installed under /opt/liquid/*.
  
8. Initialize system

	From inside Eclipse on the Java Perspective select:
	
  	Window -> Show View -> Ant
  	
  	Add: LiquidArchive/build.xml
  		Run the "reset-the-world" target.
  	This will wipe out parts of /opt/liquid, reload the database, 
  	and run the archiver/indexer on the sample mail.
  	
  	Add: LiquidConsole/build.xml
    	Run "deploy" and "admin-deploy"
    This will compile/deploy the DHTML interface and the Admin Colsole.
    	
	If you install ant standalone, you can also run "ant reset-the-world" 
	from within the LiquidArchive root directory.
     
9. Test deployment

  You should now be able to go to:

    http://localhost:7070/liquid/
  
  and login as "user1[@{hostname}]" (the domain is optional), with password 
  "test123", where {hostname} is the name of your local machine.
  
  You can log into the Admin Console by going to:
  
    https://localhost:7071/liquid/admin
    
  and login as "admin@{hostname}" (the domain is mandatory), with the password 
  "test123", where {hostname} is the name of your local machine.
