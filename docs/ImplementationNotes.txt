Implementation Notes for JAXB classes
=====================================

Manual steps
------------
*    Marshalling / Unmarshalling support.
The code that is responsible for marshalling and unmarshalling JAXB classes
needs to know about the top level requests and response classes - see the
MESSAGE_CLASSES array in :
src/java/com/zimbra/soap/JaxbUtil.java 

Ordering of elements.
---------------------
For pre-existing requests, best not to force an ordering of elements in case
this breaks clients.
For responses, because the server controls the order, it is reasonable to
enforce an order.
For new requests and responses, probably reasonable to require an order.

Enforcing an order is achieved via the @XmlType annotation.  For example :
@XmlType(propOrder = {"hostNames", "stats", "note"})

The strings in the list are the names of fields which map to elements (NOT
the @XmlElement names).
Attributes cannot be ordered, so their field names are excluded.

@XmlRootElement
---------------
SOAP Request and Response classes must have this.
In a lot of JAXB, the root element associated with a field is chosen
by the @XmlElement annotation associated with the field - so there is no
need for an @XmlRootElement.  This has the added advantage that classes can
represent types independant of the element name used with them.
Problems were encountered in some of the COS related classes when an
un-necessary @XmlRootElement was used.  On the other hand, see the gotchas.
Sometimes an @XmlRootElement is required...

@XmlAccessorType
----------------
Tend to prefer XmlAccessType.NONE and explicitly label everything that needs
to be annotated rather than letting JAXB do some defaults.

enums
-----
For the values of some fields in JAXB objects, Enums are needed under ZimbraSoap.
For preference, non-ZimbraSoap code should use the ZimbraSoap enums to avoid having
to keep 2 sets of enums in lock step.

If that isn't possible, either because an enum is already widely used or because
it references objects not visible in ZimbraSoap, then using the ZimbraSoap enum
in the constructor of the other enum should help avoid the enums getting out of step.
For example, see JAXB enum com.zimbra.soap.type.TargetType and ZimbraServer enum
com.zimbra.cs.account.accesscontrol.TargetType.  The latter enum includes the
"toJaxb()" method and the static method "fromJaxb(com.zimbra.soap.type.TargetType)".

Gotchas
-------
.   Do NOT reference non-simple classes outside the ZimbraSoap hierarchy in fields relevant to JAXB.
    Failing to do this will result in errors in the resulting WSDL as it will not have
    the information it needs to specify the structure of these classes.
.   Unmarshalling from Xml may not correctly identify superclasses.
    Test before using! e.g. See :
        JaxbToElementTest.ConvActionRequestJaxbSubclassHandlingTestDisabled()
.   Target objects for @XmlElementRef etc must have an @XmlRootElement
    annotation
.   For structured fields, e.g. comma separated strings, there is a temptation
    to use non-JAXB fields for the real data.
.   Elements which have both sub-elements AND a value.  End up having to used
    @XmlMixed which is horrible.
.   You cannot use basic types like "int" for optional attributes/variables.
    This is because need something which can have a null value to represent
    absence.

Steps to add a new namespace
----------------------------
1.  Choose a new sub-package name {PKG} and a service name {SVC}
    e.g. for AppBlast, chose {PKG}="appblast" and {SVC}=AppblastService
2.  Create new directories :
        ZimbraSoap/src/java/com/zimbra/soap/{PKG}/message
        ZimbraSoap/src/java/com/zimbra/soap/{PKG}/type
3.  Create new files:
        ZimbraSoap/src/java/com/zimbra/soap/{PKG}/message/package-info.java
        ZimbraSoap/src/java/com/zimbra/soap/{PKG}/type/package-info.java
    These can be based on similar files for another namespace.  Need to update
    namespace/package etc info in these files.
4.  Update ZimbraSoap/src/java/com/zimbra/soap/util/WsdlGenerator.java
    main method needs something like :
        createWsdl("AppblastService.wsdl",
                AppBlastConstants.NAMESPACE_STR, "AppblastService",
                "http://localhost:7070/service/soap",
                requestLists.get("com.zimbra.soap.appblast.message")
5.  Create binding files for use with wsdl-test API :
    ZimbraSoap/src/wsdl-test/wsdlBindings-{PKG}.xml
        Base this on a similar file for another namespace but update the
        <jaxws:package name to be zimbra.generated.{PKG}client.ws.service
    ZimbraSoap/src/wsdl-test/xsdBindings-{PKG}.xml
        Base this on a similar file for another namespace
        Make sure there is a jaxb:bindings section for each xsd file that
        will be imported in the .wsdl file for this namespace
        For each of those, make sure the "schemaLocation", "targetNamespace" 
        is correct.
        For the new namespace, make sure the jaxb:package name is
            zimbra.generated.{PKG}client.{PKG}
        Make sure app of the jaxb:package names in the file start with:
            zimbra.generated.{PKG}client.
6.  Update build.xml to add a target similar to :
      <target name="{PKG}-service-client-support" depends="jar">
          <service-client-support svcname="{SVC}" pathelem="{PKG}"/>
      </target>
7.  Update build.xml so that wsdl-client-support depends on the target created
    above.

Special handling
================

Boolean / boolean support using ZmBoolean
-----------------------------------------
XML schema regards the literals {true, false, 1, 0} as legal
However, the canonical representation for boolean is the set of literals {true, false} and this is reflected in
JAXB behavior when marshaling.  Historically, Zimbra Booleans have been rendered in SOAP response XML as {1, 0}
To further complicate things, SOAP response JSON uses {true, false}.

When adding Boolean or boolean attributes/elements to SOAP requests or responses :
1.  Specify the corresponding fields in JAXB with type "ZmBoolean"
2.  Add methods which get and set these fields via Boolean (or boolean).
    The static methods ZmBoolean.fromBool(Boolean), ZmBoolean.toBool(ZmBoolean) and
    ZmBoolean.toBool(ZmBoolean, boolean) should be used from these methods.
3.  Do NOT create ZmBoolean getters and setters!
4.  If you are creating an element that should be treated as an element in JSON, use an @JsonSerialize annotation,
    for example :
        @XmlElement(name=AdminConstants.E_STATUS, required=true)
        @JsonSerialize(using=ZmBooleanContentSerializer.class)
        private final ZmBoolean status;

FAQ
===
1. How do you define an XmlAttribute or XmlElement whose value is an enum
    You need to create an enum in ZimbraSoap.  Ideally, used this new enum in all code rather than duplicating
    from somewhere else.  For a fairly simple example - see
        //depot/zimbra/main/ZimbraSoap/src/java/com/zimbra/soap/type/AccountBy.java
    which uses the @XmlEnum annotation.  See
        //depot/zimbra/main/ZimbraSoap/src/java/com/zimbra/soap/admin/type/AccountSelector.java
    for how this enum is used for an @XmlAttribute.
    If you want the enum values to differ from what is in the xml, see another example - Folder.View 
        //depot/zimbra/main/ZimbraSoap/src/java/com/zimbra/soap/mail/type/Folder.java
    This also uses @XmlEnumValue annotations.

2. For some JAXB classes, @XmlElement or @XmlAttribute might have property "required" set as "false" even when it
   is not optional.  Is this intentional? 

   If the @XmlElement or @XmlAttribute is required in all contexts then this is an error.  When the original
   implementor was constructing JAXB classes, situations were encountered where looking at the first use of a
   JAXB type some of these were clearly required but later uses had them as optional.   As this situation can
   be a bit difficult to spot a lot of newer JAXB classes were written with a more relaxed view of whether
   things were required or not.

3. I'm creating new JAXB classes for a request/response in the urn:zimbraAdmin namespace which calls code which
   is already used for request/responses in the urn:zimbraAccount namespace.  Can I re-use the JAXB objects in
   package com.zimbra.soap.account.type?

   You need to ensure that you won't have namespace related problems.  If the SOAP handler code uses Element
   code to build the structure, most elements are added using Element.addElement(String).  This causes the namespace
   associated with the parent to be associated with the new element, which will often mean that it will differ
   depending on the main namespace associated with the request/response being handled and the same JAXB class cannot
   be used.

   There are 2 suggested solutions:
     1.  If the current code is only used in one namespace, then namespace lock the data structure by changing
         the creation of the top level Element for the structure from Element.addElement(String) to
         Element.addElement(QName).  Where possible, this is the preferred option as it avoids propagating almost
         duplicate JAXB objects for different namespaces.
         Check the .xsd files produced to make sure they make sense.  There is a gotcha with schemagen where
         it sometimes uses references (ref=)to the other .xsd file but has a poor algorithm for choosing the reference
         name (it just uses the xml element name).  If more than one reference ends up using the same name, you can
         end up with the target type being something like :
             <xs:element name="device" nillable="true" type="xs:anyType"/>
     2.  If the current code is used in multiple namespaces, then the approach I'm taking these days is to create
         almost duplicate JAXB objects in each namespace where the data structure is used and have the objects
         implement an interface which encapsulates the important aspects of their behavior in package
         com.zimbra.soap.base.  The plan is that when we move to using JAXB code instead of Element code we will be
         able to use the interface combined with appropriate JAXB factories.  This is rather fiddly but I don't
         thing there is a good alternative.
    Aside:
        In some cases in the past, if a JAXB class has only had @XmlAttribute (i.e. no @XmlElement)
        I have moved the JAXB class to com.zimbra.soap.type and re-used it.  This works because we have things
        setup not to tie @XmlAttribute to a namespace when processing the JAXB.  However, the issue was raised
        that this is confusing as it isn't clear why this works but objects containing elements don't.
        So, although this results in simpler code it is a deprecated practise.
