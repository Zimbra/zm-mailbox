HOW TO LOCALIZE SERVER CODE
===========================

There are some end-user facing string data created by the server.  These need
to be localized.  The first such code localized is the code that generates the
text of auto accept/decline responses sent by calendar resource accounts.

Localization relies on Java's java.util.ResourceBundle mechanism.  There is a
utility Java class and a set of localized message files.


Java Code
---------

The primary localization class is:

    com.zimbra.cs.util.L10nUtil

This class has a static public method called getMessage():

    public static String getMessage(MsgKey key,
                                    Locale lc,
                                    Object... args)

This method finds the resource bundle for the specified locale, retrieves the
string for the specified key, and applies variable substitution with any
arguments supplied.  The MsgKey enum lists all message keys known to code.

So, for example, you can do this to get a localized string for
"<calendar resource> has been scheduled for your appointment" line that appears
in the auto-accept reply:

    ipmort com.zimbra.cs.util.L10nUtil;
	import com.zimbra.cs.util.L10nUtil.MsgKey;
	...
	Locale lc = <some locale>
	String resName = <calendar resource display name>
    String str =
        L10nUtil.getMessage(MsgKey.resourceDefaultReplyAccept, lc, resName);


Message Files
-------------

All message files are stored under /opt/zimbra/conf/msgs directory.  The deafult
message file is called "ZsMsg.properties".  This name was chosen to be
consistent with the convention used in web client code.  "Z" is for Zimbra and
"s" is for server.  To add localize for a particular locale, you can add a file
named "ZsMsg_<locale name>.properties" to this directory and restart Tomcat.
Whether you're adding a new localized message file or editing one, Tomcat must
be restarted for changes to take effect.

Examples of locale name are "en_US", "en_GB", and "ja".  In other words, what
you get by calling Locale object's toString() method.

The message files are not built into the service.war web app archive for two
reasons:

    1. to allow easy installation of localized message files
    2. to allow command-line invoked Java processes to use the same localized
       message files

Message formatting tip: The single-quote character is the quote character.
If your message file has this line:

    foo = bar

the value of foo key is "bar".  The leading space is not included in the value.
If your value starts with spaces, you can do:

    foo = ' bar '

If the value contains single-quote character, it must be specified as two
single-quote characters in a row:

    foo = It''s okay.

Substitution variables cannot appear inside a quoted string.  End the quoted
part before specifying variables:

    foo = ' It''s a very '{0} car.


Windows/Cygwin Gotcha
---------------------

If you're using Windows and cygwin, don't use cygwin shell to copy the localized
file under conf/msgs directory.  Use the Windows command prompt.  Cygwin shell
somehow sets the permission on the file differently, and Tomcat running as
Windows service cannot read the file.
