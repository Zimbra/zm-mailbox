1. What is IDN
===============

IDN stands for Internationalized Domain Names.

An IDN is an Internet domain name that contains non-ASCII characters. Such domain names could 
contain letters with diacritics, as required by many European languages, or characters from 
non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese.  However, the standard for domain names does not 
allow such characters, nor could such domain names be handled by the existing DNS and name 
resolver infrastructure.

http://www.icann.org/topics/idn.html defines Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA), 
in that non-ASCII domain names should be converted into standard ASCII domain names by applications 
while preserving the stability of the domain name systems.  IDNA specifies how this conversion is 
to be done. 

Per http://www.icann.org/topics/idn.html, the three RFCs: 3490, 3491, and 3492 together define the 
IDNA protocol/behavior.

The 3 RFCs boil down to the following summaries:
(1) Non-ASCII domain names should be converted to a standard ASCII-based form, aka, 
    ASCII Compatible Encoding(ACE) by applications before handing them to DNS and name 
    resolver systems.
  
(2) An IDNA-enabled application should be able to convert between the restricted-ASCII 
    and non-ASCII representations of a domain, using the ASCII form in cases where
    it is needed (such as for DNS lookup), but being able to present the more readable 
    non-ASCII form to users.
    
(3) Support for the two conversion functions:
    A. ToASCII: 
           Used before sending an IDN to something that expects ASCII names (such as a resolver) or 
           writing an IDN into a place that expects ASCII names (such as a DNS master file).
           
    B. ToUnicode:
           Used when displaying names to users.


For example:
           Unicode name: my.中文.cn
    Equivalent ACE name: my.xn--fiq228c.cn

2. IDN Support in Zimbra Server
================================

http://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14225

2.1 Support for ToASCII and ToUnicode Conversions
        Adapted third party GNU IDN Java lib (http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn) for the two
        conversion functions.
          
          
2.2 Stored values in LDAP
        IDN domain names and email addresses are converted to ACE and stored in LDAP in ACE.  
        (Note, for domain names and email addresses that do not contain non-ASCII characters, i.e., 
         not containing IDN, their ACE value is identical to the unicode value.)
        For the following reasons:
        1. Each domain label are stored in the dc attribute in LDAP.  dc is of syntax IA5String, 
           which is "ASCII character set 7-bit" and does not allow non-ASCII characters.
        
        2. ACE in domain names and email addresses are the real routable names, they need to be 
           seen by components like Postfix when accessed from LDAP.
           
        3. For consistency, IDNs are converted to ACE and stored in ACE across the board for all 
           attributes that contain domain names or email addresses.   


2.3 Support in account/admin SOAP Request/Response
        1. SOAP Request
               Both Unicode names and ACE names will be honored by all our SOAP requests that 
               identify accounts, calendar resources, distribution lists, aliases, and domains by 
               name.  (Note, this is supported in LdapProvisioning via the Provisioning interface.  
               The names be opaque to callers of Provisioning.)
              
                   e.g. 
                   (a) <domain by="name">my.中文.cn</domain> equals to
                       <domain by="name">my.xn--fiq228c.cn</domain>
            
                   (b) <account by="name">user1@my.中文.cn</domain> equals to
                       <account by="name">user1@my.xn--fiq228c.cn</domain>
                   
        2. SOAP Response
           (A) name attribute and element in all SOAP responses are always returned in unicode(in utf8 encoding)
                   e.g. 
                   (a) <GetDomainResponse xmlns="urn:zimbraAdmin">
                           <domain id="..." name="my.中文.cn">
                            ...
                       </GetDomainResponse>
                        
                   (b) <GetAccountResponse xmlns="urn:zimbraAdmin">
                           <account id="..." name="user1@my.中文.cn">
                           ...
                       </GetAccountResponse>  
                    
                   (c) <GetInfoResponse xmlns="urn:zimbraAccount">
                           <id>...</id>
                           <name>user1@my.中文.cn</name>
                           ...
                       </GetInfoResponse>    
           
           (B) attributes containing IDN domain names or email addresses are always returned in unicode(in utf8 encoding)
                   Server will convert the values from ACE to unicode and return unicode values in SOAP responses for 
                   attributes that are either:
                       - of type email or emailp, (declared in zimbra-attrs.xml) or
                       - has idn flag (in zimbra-attrs.xml)
   
                   e.g.
                   (a) <GetDomainResponse xmlns="urn:zimbraAdmin">
                           <domain id="0eef5297-b212-4990-aad0-79e30825bf83" name="my.中文.cn">
                               <a n="o">my.xn--fiq228c.cn domain</a>                    <=== not an idn flagged or email attribute

                               <a n="zimbraDomainStatus">active</a>
                           </domain>
                       </GetDomainResponse>
                   
                   (b) <GetAccountResponse xmlns="urn:zimbraAdmin">

                           </account>
                       </GetAccountResponse>
                       
                   (c) <GetConfigResponse xmlns="urn:zimbraAdmin">
                           <a n="zimbraDefaultDomainName">mydomain.local</a>            <=== an idn flagged attribute, stored LDAP value is mydomain.local

                       </GetConfigResponse>


2.4 Support in mailing (messages, calendar invites, etc) SOAP Request/Response
        1. SOAP Request
               Both Unicode email addresses and ACE email addresses will be honored by all our SOAP requests 
               that takes email address in:
               <e [t="{type}"] p="{personal-name}" a="{email-address}" d="{display-name}">{content}</e>
           
               Server will convert the value specified by the a attribute and convert it to ACE before handing the 
               email address to any down stream code/components, since ACE is the encoding that can be resolved 
               and routed.
              
                   e.g. 
                   (a) <SendMsgRequest xmlns="urn:zimbraMail" suid="...">
                           <m idnt="...">
                               <e t="t" a="user2@my.中文.cn/>
                               <e t="f" a="user1@my.中文.cn"/>
                               <su>...</su>
                               <mp ct="text/plain">
                                   <content>...</content>
                              </mp>
                          </m>
                       </SendMsgRequest>
                   
        2. SOAP Response
               Email addresses in the a attribute in 
               <e [t="{type}"] p="{personal-name}" a="{email-address}" d="{display-name}">{content}</e>
               are always returned in Unicode(in utf8 encoding).
               
               Server will convert email values from ACE to unicode and return unicode in SOAP response.
               This conversion is done at the SOAP response boundary, after the request is handled and while 
               it encodes the SOAP response.
               
                   e.g.
                   (a) <SearchResponse xmlns="urn:zimbraMail" more="0" sortBy="dateDesc" offset="0">
                           <c d="1191365996000" sf="1191365996000" f="su" id="259" score="1.0" n="2">
                               <su>A subject</su>
                               <fr>good day</fr>
                               <e a="user1@my.中文.cn" t="f" d="user1"></e>
                               <m id="258"></m>
                           </c>
                       </SearchResponse>
               
               
     
2.5 LDAP Search Filters
    For SOAP SearchDirectory and zmprov searchAccounts(sa) commands, server 
    converts assertion values in the query to ACE, then put together the massaged 
    query and hand it to LDAP search.
    
    Note: for IDN, there is a limitation that the assertion value has to 
    be at least the entire label if the label is not ASCII.  This is because 
    by RFC the ToASCII and ToUnicode algorithms are not applied to the 
    domain name as a whole or as individual characters, but rather to 
    individual labels. For example, if the domain name is 
    www.example.com, then the labels are www, example and com, and 
    ToASCII or ToUnicode would be applied to each of these three 
    separately.
    
    For example, for domain my.中文.cn
        - examples of good queries:
              (zimbraDomainName=*中文*)
    
        - examples of bad queries:
              (zimbraDomainName=*文*)
              
    
2.6 Address Book Lookup and Display
    Address book SOAP commands are not treated with any ACE <-> Unicode conversion.
    Emails in address book contact will be stored and returned in SOAP responses as how 
    they are entered in the address book - either typed by user or added automatically.  
    That is, if ACE is entered, it will be stored and returned in ACE; if Unicode is 
    entered, it will be stored and returned in Unicode.
    
    When email address of contact is used to address mails, it will be converted to ACE by 
    the server as described in 2.4.
