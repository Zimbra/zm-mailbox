============
Introduction
============
It is required that Zimbra server should allow server extensions to register 
a mechanism that can implement auth.  Today we allow external auth via LDAP, 
but this would let us do external auth to a provider's proprietary identity 
database.

================
SOAP AuthRequest
================
Currently the AuthRequest SOAP API can identify the account by name, id, or
foreignPrincipal.  

For example:
	
 <AuthRequest xmlns="urn:zimbraAccount">
   <account by="id">15b89480-45d9-4d7a-b6bb-42997a54466c</account>]
   <password>test123</password>]
 </AuthRequest>
 
 <AuthRequest xmlns="urn:zimbraAccount">
   <account by="name">user1@zimbra.com</account>]
   <password>test123</password>]
 </AuthRequest>
 
 <AuthRequest xmlns="urn:zimbraAccount">
   <account by="foreignPrincipal">6502127767</account>]
   <password>test123</password>]
 </AuthRequest>

The current AuthRequest SOAP command is going to be used for custom auth.
When an AuthRequest comes in, system will check the designated auth mechanhism 
for the domain.  If it is set to custom auth, system will invoke the registered 
custom auth handler to authenticate the user.


================================================
Where does the custom handler reside at runtime?
================================================
It has to be implemented and deployed as defined by the Zimbra extension framework
Please refer to ZimbrServer/docs/extensions.txt for developing and deploying 
server extensions.


==================================
Preparing a domain for custom auth
==================================
Domain is the scope for authentication mechanisms.  To enable a domain for custom 
auth, set the domain attribute zimbraAuthMech to:
	custom:{registered-custom-auth-hanlder-name} [arg1 arg2 ...]

For example:
zmprov modifyDomain {domain|id} zimbraAuthMech custom:sample http://foo.com:123 "  bar abc"

In the above example:
- "sample" is the name under which a custom auth handler is registered.  
- "http://foo.com:123" and "  bar abc" are arguments that will be passed to the authenticate 
  method of the handler.


===========================================
Registering a custom authentication handler
===========================================
Invoke ZimbraCustomAuth.register(handlerName, handler) in the init method of the extension.  
Details below.

Class: 
    com.zimbra.cs.account.auth.ZimbraCustomAuth
    
Method:
	public synchronized static void register(String handlerName, ZimbraCustomAuth handler);
	
	    handlerName: 
	        Name under which this custom auth handler is registered to 
	        Zimbra's authentication infrastructure.  This is the name that 
	        needs to be set in the zimbraAuthMech attribute of the domain 
	        that uses this custom auth.  For example, if the registered 
	        name here is "sample", then zimbraAuthMech must be set to
	        custom:sample.
	
        handler:
        	The object on which the authenticate method will be invoke for this 
        	custom auth handler.  It has to be an instance of ZimbraCustomAuth 
        	(or subclasses of it).  See "Handling authenticating requests in extension" 
        	for description on the ZimbraCustomAuth class.
        	

For example:

public class SampleExtensionCustomAuth implements ZimbraExtension {

    public void init() throws ServiceException {
        /* 
         * Register to Zimbra's authentication infrastructure
         * 
         * custom:sample should be set for domain attribute zimbraAuthMech 
         */
        ZimbraCustomAuth.register("sample", new SampleCustomAuth());
    }
    
    ...
}
     

=============================================
Handling authenticating requests in extension
=============================================
When an AuthRequest come in, if the domain is specified to use custom auth
(by settting the zimbraAuthMech domain attribute to custom:{...}), the 
authenticating framework will invoke the authenticate method on the ZimbraCustomAuth 
instance passed as the handler parameter to ZimbraCustomAuth.register().

The account object for the principal to be authenticated and the clear-text password 
entered by user are passed to the ZimbraCustomAuth.authenticate() method.  All 
attributes of the account can be retrieved from the account object.   

Basically, there is no limitation on what can be done in ZimbraCustomAuth.authenticate 
in order to auth an user.  It can be as simple as an one liner, or it can go off to 
the internet using whatever protocol of choice.   
 
It is very important to note that the same instance(the instance passed in to the
register() method) of ZimbraCustomAuth object is invoked for all auth requests that
need to go through this custom auth handler.  It is the implementor's resposibility 
to ensure thread safety during the life span of ZimbraCustomAuth.authenticate().
 
The authenticate method should do one of the following to indicate to the framework 
the result of the auth.

- auth succeeded: return
     If the method returns, it indicates the authentication has succeeded.
     
- auth failed: throw Exception
     If an Exception is thrown, it indicates the authtication has failed.
     (1) if the Exception is an instance of com.zimbra.common.service.ServiceException, 
         the same exception instance will be re-thrown by the framework to the SOAP 
         AuthRequest.
     (2) if the Exception is not an instance of com.zimbra.common.service.ServiceException,
     	 the framework will catch the Exception and throw AccountServiceException.AUTH_FAILED 
     	 exception to the SOAP AuthRequest.
     
 
The ZimbraCustomAuth class and relavent methods for implementors:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

public abstract class ZimbraCustomAuth {

    /*
     * Register a custom auth handler.
     * It should be invoked from the init() method of ZimbraExtension.
     */
    public synchronized static void register(String handlerName, ZimbraCustomAuth handler);
    
    /*
     * Method invoked by the framework to handle authentication requests.
     * A custom auth implementation must implement this abstract method.
     * 
     * @param account: The account object of the principal to be authenticated
     *                 all attributes of the account can be retrieved from this object.
     *                   
     * @param password: Clear-text password.
     * 
     * @param context: Map containing context information.  
     *                 A list of context data is defined in com.zimbra.cs.account.AuthContext
     * 
     * @param args: Arguments specified in the zimbraAuthMech attribute
     * 
     * @return Returning from this function indicating the authentication has succeeded. 
     *  
     * @throws Exception.  If authentication failed, an Exception should be thrown.
     */
    public abstract void authenticate(Account acct, String password, Map<String, Object> context, List<String> args) throws Exception;
}

Implementor should extend the ZimbraCustomAuth and implement the authenticate method.

For example:

public class SampleCustomAuth extends ZimbraCustomAuth {

    public void authenticate(Account acct, 
                             String password, 
                             Map<String, Object> context, 
                             List<String> args) throws Exception {
        /*
         * mock logic to demo:
         *     - usage of the parameters
         *     - returning for success auth 
         *     - throwing Zimbra ServiceException for unsuccessful auth.
         *     - throwing non ServiceException for unsuccessful auth.
         */ 
        if (!password.equals("too-old"))
           throw AccountServiceException.CHANGE_PASSWORD();
         
        if (!password.equals("test123"))
           throw MyException("Invalid password!!");
           
        // returning indicating the auth has succeeded
    }
}
