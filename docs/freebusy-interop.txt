Requirement

In many cases ZCS is deployed in an environment where there is a mix of
Zimbra server and 3rd party servers.  In such environment, typically the users
are partitioned into a group using Zimbra server, and a group using 3rd party
servers.  When a user wants to schedule a meeting with other users, the 
free/busy schedule of the other users is readily available only if 
the attendees are in the same group as the organizer.  

Some calendaring software allows limited interop with 3rd party systems.  
For example Outlook allows downloading free/busy schedule for a user from 
a web server.  However, configuring URL for each attendees can be a tedious 
task.  It would be desirable if Zimbra server can provide server to server 
free/busy sync with 3rd party servers.  Then the Zimbra users will be able to 
query the free/busy schedule of users on other system, such as Exchange 
or Domino server, the same way they would query the Zimbra users.  

Zimbra should also support pushing free/busy schedule of Zimbra users to the 
3rd party server, if the 3rd party server supports such features.


--------------------------
Free/busy Provider Framework

Zimbra provides a framework where the interop with any 3rd party system
can be added via an extension.  Through the extension, Zimbra server can
query the free/busy schedule of users on 3rd party system, and also
propagate free/busy schedule of a Zimbra user to the 3rd party system.
The mechanism is described later in the document.


--------------------------
Interop with Exchange 2003

Zimbra server has a default implementation of Exchange free busy provider.
Zimbra server can pull the free/busy schedule of a user on Exchange, and
also push the free/busy schedule of a Zimbra user to Exchange server.  The
retrieval of free/busy (Exchange to Zimbra) is done via REST interface
on the Exchange server.  The propagation of free/busy (Zimbra to Exchange)
is done via WebDAV interface on the Exchange server.  In both cases, Zimbra
needs to authenticate to the Exchange server via HTTP basic authentication.

In order to enable the default Exchange free busy interop implementation, 
the following conditions need to be met.

1.  There is no more than one Active Directory in the Exchange environment.
2.  Zimbra server can access HTTP(S) port of IIS on at least one of the 
    Exchange server.
3.  The web interface to Exchange public folders (http://server/public/) needs
    to be available via IIS.
4.  Zimbra users need to be provisioned as a contact on Active Directory using
    the same administrative group.
5.  The value of 'cn' in attribute legacyExchangeDN must be the localpart
    of the email address for all Zimbra contacts.
    
The condition #4 and #5 are required only for Zimbra -> Exchange free/busy 
replication.  With the first three condition met, Exchange -> Zimbra free/busy 
lookup is still possible.

For condition 4, select the same administrative group in the new contact
wizard for all Zimbra contacts.  For condition 5, set the alias of the
contact to be the localpart of the email address.  (if email address is
james@mycompany.com, set the alias to be james).  That means if there is
more than one domain on Zimbra server, the default Exchange implementation
can't be used because localpart alone is ambiguous without the domain.  
However, it's easy to extend the Exchange provider to handle more complex 
cases as described in the next section.

After creating the contacts, legacyExchangeDN attribute can be verified by 
running ADSI Edit tool, open the contact object.  Search for the attribute 
legacyExchangeDN for the contact.  For example the attribute value would be

legacyExchangeDN : /o=First Organization/ou=First Administrative Group/cn=Recipients/cn=james

The substring left and right of /cn=Recipients are important, and need to
be consistent across the Zimbra contacts.

There are five global config variables on Zimbra to enable the interop with
Exchange server.

zimbraFreebusyExchangeAuthUsername
zimbraFreebusyExchangeAuthPassword
zimbraFreebusyExchangeAuthScheme
zimbraFreebusyExchangeURL
zimbraFreebusyExchangeUserOrg

zimbraFreebusyExchangeAuthUsername and zimbraFreebusyExchangeAuthPassword are
used to authenticate against Exchange server on REST and WebDAV interface.
zimbraFreebusyExchangeAuthScheme can be set to 'basic' or 'form', depending
on how Exchange server is configured.  When set to basic, Zimbra will
attempt HTTP basic authentication.  When set to 'form', it will POST
HTML form to /exchweb/bin/auth/owaauth.dll to get the auth Cookie set.
zimbraFreebusyExchangeURL should be set to the URL of the Exchange server.
zimbraFreebusyExchangeUserOrg is the first part of the administrative group.
Typically they are set to "/o=First Organization/ou=First Administrative Group".
Note that the value Org is from legacyExchangeDN attribute of the user,
not the DN of the user object.

Use zmprov tool to set the global config variables.  For example, assuming
the user zimbra exists on the Exchange server on exchange.mycompany.com
with password 'changeme' :

# zmprov mcf zimbraFreebusyExchangeAuthUsername zimbra
# zmprov mcf zimbraFreebusyExchangeAuthPassword changeme
# zmprov mcf zimbraFreebusyExchangeAuthScheme basic
# zmprov mcf zimbraFreebusyExchangeURL http://exchange.mycompany.com
# zmprov mcf zimbraFreebusyExchangeUserOrg "/o=First Organization/ou=First Administrative Group"


--------------------------
Complex Exchange environment

If there is more than one AD, or if the Exchange users are partitioned into
different Exchange servers, or if there is more than one Zimbra mail domain, 
the default Exchange provider above needs to be extended to work in 
such environment.  Zimbra provides a Java interface

    com.zimbra.cs.fb.ExchangeFreeBusyProvider.ExchangeResolver

The interface requires one method

    public ServerInfo getServerInfo(String emailAddr);

The resolver implementation should take an email address of a user on AD,
then return ServerInfo object.  If the user is not found in AD it should
return null.  ServerInfo is defined as

    public static class ServerInfo {
        public String url;
        public String org;
        public String cn;
        public String authUsername;
        public String authPassword;
        public AuthScheme scheme;  // basic or form
    }

Finally, the bootstrapping of the exchange provider can be done via
ZimbraExtension.  Following is an example to illustrate how this
can be implemented.

    public class FbExtension implements ZimbraExtension {
        public void init() {
            ExchangeFreeBusyProvider.registerResolver(new ExchangeUserResolver() {
                public ServerInfo getServerInfo(String emailAddr) {
                    ServerInfo info = new ServerInfo();
                    info.url = "http://exchange.mycompany.com";
                    info.authUsername = "zimbra";
                    info.authPassword = "changeme";
                    info.scheme = AuthScheme.basic;
                    info.org = "/o=First Organization/ou=First Administrative Group";
                    info.cn = emailAddr;
                    if (emailAddr.indexOf('@') > 0)
                        info.cn = emailAddr.substring(0, emailAddr.indexOf('@'));
                    return info;
                }
            }, 0);
        }
    
        public void destroy() {
        }
        
        public String getName() {
            return "ExtensionFbProvider";
        }
    }


--------------------------
Interop with other non-Exchange systems

Zimbra can handle other 3rd party system by extending the FreeBusyProvider
framework.  

    public abstract class FreeBusyProvider {
        public abstract FreeBusyProvider getInstance();
        public abstract String getName();
        
        // free/busy lookup from 3rd party system
        public abstract void addFreeBusyRequest(Request req) throws FreeBusyUserNotFoundException;
        public abstract Set<FreeBusy> getResults();
        
        // propagation of Zimbra users free/busy to 3rd party system
        public abstract boolean registerForMailboxChanges();
        public abstract boolean handleMailboxChange(String accountId);
        public abstract long cachedFreeBusyStartTime();
        public abstract long cachedFreeBusyEndTime();
    }

The API allows batching of lookup requests.  The framework invokes 
addFreeBusyRequest() for each non-Zimbra users.  The provider implementation
should throw FreeBusyUserNotFoundException when the user is not found.
This allows for multiple FreeBusyProviders to co-exist in the system.
The framework will then call getResults(), and at that point the provider
returns a set of FreeBusy for the batched requests.

If the provider can handle propagation of Zimbra users free/busy,
it should declare it so by returning true on registerForMailboxChanges().
Then the framework will call handleMailboxChange() for each providers
when a change in the mailbox that could result in recalculation of free/busy
is detected.  cachedFreeBusyStartTime() and cachedFreeBusyEndTime() are
millis since epoch to indicate the interval of free/busy that can be cached 
in the 3rd party system.  For example the basic exchange free/busy provider
caches free/busy from the beginning of the month, for two months.
