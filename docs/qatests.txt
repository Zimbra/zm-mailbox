Running QA Test Suite in Eclipse
--------------------------------

Developers can run QA test suite in Eclipse before check ins.  After building
LiquidArchive project, check out LiquidQA project and run the test targets in
build.xml.  There are two targets defined, "Dev Pre-Checkin Sanity Check" and
"Run All Tests".  The first one is a minimal set of tests that used to exist
in LiquidArchive project.  It has been moved into LiquidQA.

The second test is nearly identical to the test run by build machine after
each build and includes all tests created by QA team.  It may take a while to
run through the test, and execution time will grow as QA team adds more tests,
but it's a good thing to run it to avoid introducing bugs.

Run All Tests target executes all *.xml test input files under
LiquidQA/data/soapvalidator directory and its subdirectories.  Any new files
added will be processed automatically.

Some of the tests create many test accounts.  These accounts have names that
include timestamp to avoid collision with repeated test execution.  The
accounts are not cleaned up by the tests.  Run LiquidArchive reset-the-world
to remove them.

Currently (3/30/2005) all tests can be repeated successfully without requiring
reset-the-world between each execution.  But this is not a requirement for the
test cases.  They are guaranteed to pass only after a reset-the-world.  If the
tests fail for you, try rerunning it after reset-the-world.

The test driver class is SoapTestCore.  This is what build.xml targets invoke.
SoapTestCore depends on classes from LiquidArchive project.  So make sure to
build LiquidArchive project before running test targets.  More specifically,
liquidstore.jar file must be built (jar target in LiquidArchive/build.xml).
