IMJoinChat -- join OR CREATE a multi-user chat
----------
-- Join the specified chat.  If a threadId is specified, then the
   already-open chat thread is connected to the specified MUC room,
   otherwise a new chat is created.
-- If the specified room (specified by "addr") doesn't exist, the room
   is created

<IMJoinChatRequest [nickname="nickname] [password="password"] [thread="threadId"] addr="chatAddr"/>

        addr: the full address of the room.  This should be of the form
              ROOMNAME@CONFERENCE_SERVICE - eg
              myroom@conference.myhost.com  See IMListConferenceRooms
              as a way to get a list of CONFERENCE_SERVICEs available 
 
        thread: used for converting a 1:1 chat into a MUC

        nickname: the "nickname" used for you in the room.  All users
                  in a room are required to have a unique nickname in
                  that room.  If you don't specify on, the server will
                  use your bare username (the part of your name before
                  the @ sign) as your nickname.  If you get a
                  "NicknameConflict" response, you will have to try a
                  different name.

        password: used to enter password-protected rooms


<IMJoinChatResponse thread="threadId" status="STATUS1,STATUS2,..." [error="ERROR"]

-- If the "NewRoomCreated" status is set, then this is a new room and
   you're the owner!  The room is created in the "locked" state until
   configured.  You need to (at the very least) send an

   other people to enter the room

STATUS codes:

        RemovedForMembersOnly // 322 - room is now members-only, and you aren't a member
        RemovedShutdown // 332 - system or conference service is shutting down

ERROR codes:
    PasswordRequired - couldn't enter room password required
    Banned - room owner has banned you from the room
    NoSuchRoom - 
    NotAllowed - Room doesn't exist, and you're not allowed to create a new one
    MustUseReservedRoomnick - 
    NotAMember - Room is invite-only, and you aren't a member
    NicknameConflict - Someone else is already using your nickname
    MaxUsers - Room has reached capacity
    Unknown

IMGetPrivacyList -- request the privacy list
-----------------
<IMGetPrivacyListRequest [name="list_name"]/> // gets default list if

IMGatewayList - gateways to external IM services
--------------

[     <registration  name="remoteName" state="connectionState" [timeUntilNextConnect="msec_until_next_connect_attempt"/> ] ]
  </service>
</IMGatewayListResponse/>

connectedState is one of:
   bad_auth               -- auth is bad, will not try to reconnect
   intentionally_offline  -- user's local im presence is "offline" so not connected
   disabled               -- the user's account has been disabled, we will not try to reconnect
                               (this is probably b/c we detected the user logged into the service
                                directly from another location)
   online
   shutdown               -- shutting down
   start                  -- just created, will attempt first connect soon
   trying_to_connect      -- connection attempt in progress
NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET:   booted_by_other_login  -- will not retry connect: someone has connected to our account has connected from another place

IMGatewayRegister 
-----------------
<IMGatewayRegisterRequest op="reg" service="SERVICE_NAME" name="remoteName" password="remotePassword"/>
<IMGatewayRegisterRequest op="unreg" service="SERVICE_NAME"/>
<IMGatewayRegisterRequest op="reconnect" service="SERVICE_NAME"/> // tell the service to try a reconnect right now, also re-enable if the service was in the disabled state

<IMGatewayRegisterResponse result="0|1"/>


IMSetIdle
-----------------
<IMSetIdleRequest isIdle="1|0" idleTime="seconds_idle"/>
<IMSetIdleResponse/>

-- idleTime is number of seconds since last user action.  Client should
make a best-effort to calculate this, but is free to return "0" if
unsupported.

-- Throws ServiceException.SESSION_REQUIRED if there is no session
   referenced (a session MUST be active for this API to be used)

When calculating presence, the sever will look at the "idle" values of
all active web client sessions.  If all sessions are "idle" then the
server will update the user's status to "away".

The web client must be careful to unset the "idle" status when the
user comes back, otherwise the user's presence will be stuck in the
"Away" state and the user won't understand why.
