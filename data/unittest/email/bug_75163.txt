The Ming Dynasty, also Empire of the Great Ming, was the ruling dynasty of 
China from 1368 to 1644, following the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan 
Dynasty. The Ming, "one of the greatest eras of orderly government and 
social stability in human history",[2] was the last dynasty in China ruled 
by ethnic Han Chinese. Although the Ming capital Beijing fell in 1644 to a 
rebellion led by Li Zicheng who established the Shun Dynasty, which was soon 
replaced by the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty, regimes loyal to the Ming throne 
(collectively called the Southern Ming) survived until 1662.
